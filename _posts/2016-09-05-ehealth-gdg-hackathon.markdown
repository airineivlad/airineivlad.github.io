description: Awarder 2nd place at GDG eHealth Hackthon in 2016, Bucharest by developing a hands-free platform integrated with vocal commands which consists of an Android App and a Website. Using cloud-based solutions such as Google Firebase, my team and I delivered a rapid-prototype that reduces by 80% the time spend on completing the registration forms. In addition, the application offered analytics on patient data, priority management based on the level of emergency for each patient.
