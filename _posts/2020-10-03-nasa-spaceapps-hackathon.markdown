description: Interactive World Map which has embedded an automatic hazard detection based on Machine Learning Models. The web application provided integration with Google Maps for displaying the map in an intuitive UI which was calling NASA/MODIS APIs for getting satellite data from particular coordinates. Afterwards the satellite images were passed through an ML model to predict the probability of a hazard in the selected area. The models were trained with images provided by NASA Experts as part of this Hackathon.
